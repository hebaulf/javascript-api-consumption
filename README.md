## What I learnt in Santiagos workshop

#### I learnt...

- Client-server architecture
- to use JSON data for content.
- to make HTTP requests to web servers using "fetch()" and to get a response back from a server.
- to use different http methods to make requests/responses, e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH
  - GET is one of the most common HTTP methods, it is used to request data from a specified resource.
  - POST is also one of the most common HTTP methods is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
  - PUT is used to send data to a server to update a resource but you have to update everything in that resource, else some data might get lost.
  - PATCH is also used to send data to a server to update a resource but only updates the item that is being patched.
  - DELETE deletes the specified resource.
- to use an async-await function
  - Async ensures that the function returns a promise, and wraps non-promises in it.
  - Await makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.
